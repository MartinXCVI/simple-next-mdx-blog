# Building Scalable APIs with GraphQL

## Introduction: Why GraphQL?

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives clients the power to request exactly the data they need, improving performance and flexibility.

## Key Advantages

- Fetch multiple resources in a single request  
- Avoid over-fetching and under-fetching  
- Strongly typed schema for predictability  

```graphql
query GetUser {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
```

### Scaling Strategies

- Schema Stitching: Combine multiple schemas into one.
- Query Caching: Store frequent queries in memory.
- Pagination: Avoid massive payloads.

```
// Example resolver with pagination
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: (_, { limit, offset }, { db }) =>
      db.posts.slice(offset, offset + limit),
  },
};
```

## Conclusion

GraphQL, when paired with good scaling practices, can handle high-traffic applications without sacrificing performance.

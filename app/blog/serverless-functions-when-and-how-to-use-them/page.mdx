# Serverless Functions: When and How to Use Them

## Introduction

Serverless architecture allows you to run backend code without managing servers, paying only for actual execution time.

## Benefits

- Scalability on demand  
- Reduced operational overhead  
- Lower costs for low-traffic workloads  

```javascript
// AWS Lambda handler example
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Serverless!" }),
  };
};
```

### When to Use

- APIs with unpredictable traffic
- Scheduled jobs
- Event-driven processes

### When Not to Use

- Long-running tasks
- Low-latency real-time applications
